Medfin is a healthcare start-up that is not only disrupting but also reimagining the surgeries landscape in India. Our aim is to give patients access to the latest surgical procedures that ensure quicker recovery and better outcomes at the most affordable costs. 

Medfin’s model of healthcare delivery is designed to tailor the hospital care model for inclusion. People in developing countries like India often get side-lined owing to the lack of affordable care outside of government setups. Modularizing and re-arrangement of surgery blocks leads to never-before-seen flexibility and reduction in costs of surgeries. 

Adding to this lowering of costs, Medfin actively works towards improving medical outcomes. Medfin works with surgeons who are trained in the latest minimally invasive day care procedures. These procedures ensure a hassle-free surgical experience and quick recovery for patients. 

Medfin hand holds a patient right from the day of their first consultation, till they are discharged after surgery. Medfin handles all things in between including insurance processing, medical financing (EMI), booking of diagnostics and booking of follow-up consultations. Medfin is truly a discovery-to-recovery partner.
