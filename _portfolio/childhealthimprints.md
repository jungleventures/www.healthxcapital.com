Child Health Imprints (CHIL), a company incorporated for improving clinical care outcomes in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) using bed side IoT and Artificial intelligence based disease prediction capability.According to a WHO report published in 2017, globally 2.5 million babies die within the first 27 days of their life. Prematurity, infections, delay in treatment, skill manpower shortage and human-based medical errors are the major causes of neonatal deaths. Lack of data integration amongst multiple devices (patient monitor, ventilaor, blood gas machines, infusion pumps) in a NICU, EMR adoption in NICU and unified neonatal workflow practices are urgent needs of rising neonatal births across world.

Harpreet Singh & Ravneet Kaur faced similar challenges when their twins were born preterm and one of twins passed away within one week of birth due to NEC. They built bedside IoT based technology comprising of NEO that interoperates with various medical devices used in NICU. NEO aggregated data in a vendor agnostic manner offering temporal (longitudinal) data of their stay in NICU that reduces manual charting effort of nurses. The solution also comprises a  bedside tablet based interface to ensure prospective data entry, which is supported by artificial intelligence based iNICU analytics engine that infers millions of data-points persisted in time-series representation. By leveraging clinical rules and deep learning based disease specific (Respiratory Distress, Sepsis, BPD) analytical models, iNICU assist the neonatologists in focussing on neonatal care and identifying the early onset of diseases. They further plan to setup collaboration with machine learning expert in one of the largest university NICU in US and improve their decision support offering as the company launches from its Singapore home base to grow in new markets in Asia.
