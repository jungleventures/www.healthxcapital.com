Breath Diagnostics, Inc. (“Breath-Dx”), is a medical device diagnostics company developing a novel, patented breath analysis system to quantify cancer-specific markers in exhaled breath. The Company’s proprietary technology, OneBreath®, offers a unique solution providing accurate, affordable, and safe lung cancer detection by analysing a single exhaled breath. Breath Dx’s innovative platform can selectively detect a spectrum of predictive markers and therefore has the potential to expand into other cancer indications as well as a variety of other disease states.

OneBreath® utilizes a proprietary silica microreactor coated with a novel chemical reagent that captures specific Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from a single exhaled breath sample which can be quantitatively analyzed by conventionally available liquid chromatography-mass spectrometers. The OneBreath® test can deliver definitive results within 24 hours of sample collection using the safest method for lung cancer detection/diagnosis to date.

The OneBreath® test can be done in office-based, and retail (pharmacy/drugstores) settings, enabling greater accessibility to lung cancer screening and diagnosis for the general population, which will enhance the potential for early detection.
